### Project 0
A Scala CLI (Command Line Interface) application.  Data should be parsed from a CSV or JSON file and persisted to MongoDB.  The functionality of the application beyond that is up to you, but here are a few suggestions:
- journal app
- banking app
- business management system
- simple text-based game
- productivity tool

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.9.0
- MongoDB
- git SCM (on GitHub)

Note: This program requires MongoDB running on the localhost.
